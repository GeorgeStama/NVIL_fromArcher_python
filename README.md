# Neural Variational Inference (NVIL) Example in Python and Theano

This is a reference implementation of the Neural Variational Inference and Learning (NVIL) variational inference algorithm, as described in the following publication:

* Mnih, Andriy, and Karol Gregor. "Neural Variational Inference and Learning in Belief Networks." Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-14). 2014.

We include an implementation of the NVIL algorithm, and a simple application to inference in a Gaussian Mixture Model illustrated in an [IPython notebook](https://github.com/earcher/nvil_example/blob/master/code/test_NVIL.ipynb).
